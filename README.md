# Introduction

Book Game is an interactive game about making a good choice of children's books for a school presentation. It allows the user to input some data, follow the text-based instructions and questions displayed at the terminal. If the instructions are followed correctly, they will get their desired choice printed to the terminal. The user have to be carreful because there are also some books which are not appropriate for children.

This is the third of five Milestone projects that the developer is required to complete as part of their full web development course at the Code Institute. The main requirements were to create an App using mainly *Python Programming Language*.

# UX

## Ideal User Demographic

* The ideal user of the game: Everyone who wants to have a good presentation book for a child

## User Stories

User Goals:

* I would like to run the program whenever I want
* I would like to choose the type of book that I want
* I would like to choose the book I want
* I would like to know more about the book that I chose
* I would like to make another choice easily

# Features

## Existing Features

1. Run Program Button
    * At the top of the terminal, there is a green button which allows the user to run the program from the start whenever he wants.

2. Terminal Area
    * This section allows the user to start the program, follow the instructions and enter data.

3. Gif
    * On top of the program, there is an animation gif, which brings an attractiveness to the game.

3. Program Structure
    * In the Planning Stage of the project, the developer used a Flow Chart to conceptualise and bring the Book Game idea in life. Flow Chart was created in [Diagram Software and Flowchart Maker](https://www.diagrams.net/).

## Features to implement in the future

* More questions, create more situations to make the game more fun while keeping the basic objective of choosing a book.

# Testing

Testing information can be found in a separate [testing file]().

# Deployment

This project was committed to Git and push to GitHub using the workspace terminal.

## Deployment on Heroku

To deploy this program to Heroku, the developer followed these steps:

1. Create requirements.txt by typing Pip3 freeze > requirements.txt in the workspace terminal
2. Log into [Heroku]()
3. Create new APP 
4. Rename the APP
5. Choose the region
6. Select Settings from the menu at the top
7. Go to Config Vars 
8. Click to Reveal Config Vars if you have sensitive information to put in
9. Go to Buildpack
10. Click to add builpack and add in order: Python the node.js
11. Select Deploy from the menu at the top
12. Go to deployment method and then click to GitHub 
13. Connect to [GitHub]()
14. Search and Link up our GitHub repository code to Heroku app
15. Scroll down to manual deploy
16. Click to Deploy branch
17. After python, all requirements.txt file, and node.js installed, we can see the 'App was successfully deployed' message
18. Below there is a button to take us to the [deployed link](https://book-choicegame.herokuapp.com/)
